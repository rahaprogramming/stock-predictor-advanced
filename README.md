# stock-predictor-advanced

To use this code, you can call the predict_stock_price() function and pass in the filenames for the saved model, the news data, and the historical stock data:

python
<br/>
predicted_price = predict_stock_price('model.h5', 'merged_news_data.csv', 'stock_data.csv
<br/>
print('Predicted stock price:', predicted_price)
<br/>
This will output the predicted stock price based on the trained model and the latest news sentiment data.
